I'm a full-stack software developer working mostly in Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React.
I work at the [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org) as a senior DevOps engineer in the [SQuaRE team](https://github.com/lsst-sqre) on the Rubin Science Platform, documentation platform, and developer services.
I also run [J.Sick Codes](https://www.jsick.codes), where I write code for more amazing astronomy projects like [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org).

âš¡ Fun fact: I got my PhD in astrophysics for an optical and infrared survey of the Andromeda Galaxy.

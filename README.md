I'm a full-stack software developer working mostly in Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React.
I work at the [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org) as a senior DevOps engineer in the [SQuaRE team](https://github.com/lsst-sqre) on the Rubin Science Platform, documentation platform, and developer services.
I also run [J.Sick Codes](https://www.jsick.codes), where I write code for more amazing astronomy projects like [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org).

âš¡ Fun fact: I got my PhD in astrophysics for an optical and infrared survey of the Andromeda Galaxy.

##### ðŸ†• What I'm working on in September 2022

- I'm updating the theme and infrastructure for Rubin Observatory's user guides in [Documenteer](https://documenteer.lsst.io/guides/index.html). I'm adding a TOML-based configuration layer on top of Sphinx's `conf.py` ot make it easier to use and customize in specific Rubin projects.

In August 2022:

- Adding PR checks support to Times Square, our app for publishing parameterized notebooks that are rendered and hosted on the Rubin Science Platform ([lsst-sqre/times-square](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/times-square) and [lsst-sqre/squareone](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone))
- Exploring Storybook for developing React components and incrementally building design systems
